# GPU Programming Models Examples

This repository accompanies the GPU Programming Models talk from the August
2023 Frontier Workshop: https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/calendar/frontier-training-workshop-august-2023/

Each directory contains an example code for the particular model (HIP, OpenMP
Offload, Kokkos) and the different build scripts for compiling the code using
Make or CMake, for different Programming Environments on Crusher/Frontier. Each
directory has its own README file with an explanation.
