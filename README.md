# GPU Programming Models Examples

This repository accompanies the GPU Programming Models talk from the February 2023 Frontier Workshop: (link)

Each directory contains an example code for the particular model (HIP, OpenMP Offload, Kokkos) and the different build scripts 
for compiling the code in different ways, for different Programming Environments on Crusher/Frontier. Each
directory has its own README file with an explanation.
